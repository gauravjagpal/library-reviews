## CONTENTS






## Site Objectives

Design and create a review site to demonstrate an increasing understanding of the libraries and frameworks available to developers.

My three main objectives were:

- ### Create a readable, clean and responsive front end

  I wanted to make a sute that is easy to access and navigate for the users. Django and Bootstrap were used to create and style the front end.

- ### Make use of available backend functionality

  The use of the backend framework allows users to create a profile, leave a review and/or edit any of the books on the site (with authorisation), as well as deleting their own comments should they wish to.

- ### Store data on an external cloud database

  I used PostgreSQL database for this project.

# Design Choices

## Colour Scheme

The colour scheme used for this project was based on the colors from Code Institute's 'I think therefore I blog' walkthrough module. I have added and modified many aspects of the styling and colours to suit my site. It is a fairly neutral scheme, with only the actionable aspects (buttons/links etc) displayed in brighter colours for ease of navigation or site use.

## Typography

The main font used is Sans-Serif

## Logo and Favicon

The logo was created using a fonts anf styling
